-how does warp aggregated atomic filter works slower than normal atomic filter, as opposed what this blog
claims: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-optimized-filtering-warp-aggregated-atomics/

-why is there a performance difference between vector add ILP maximization code with vector add vectorized load
with the former works faster than the latter?
